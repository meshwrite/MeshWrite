# MeshWrite: Progress

## What Works

As we're just starting the adaptation of RooCode to MeshWrite, the current working components are:

1. **Base RooCode Functionality**:

    - VSCode extension infrastructure
    - AI agent communication framework
    - Chat interface
    - File and terminal operations
    - Settings management

2. **Project Setup**:
    - Repository structure
    - Development environment
    - Memory bank documentation

## What's Left to Build

1. **UI Adaptations**:

    - [ ] Update terminology throughout the UI to be writer-focused
    - [ ] Change icons to reflect writing tasks
    - [ ] Modify color scheme and visual design for creative writers
    - [ ] Update welcome screens and onboarding for writers

2. **Task Cards Feature**:

    - [ ] Design Task Card data structure
    - [ ] Create UI components for Task Cards
    - [ ] Implement Task Card creation and editing
    - [ ] Develop Task Card organization and filtering
    - [ ] Add linking between Task Cards and writing files

3. **Writing-Specific Features**:

    - [ ] Character development tools
    - [ ] Plot structure templates
    - [ ] World-building assistance
    - [ ] Dialogue generation helpers
    - [ ] Research integration tools

4. **AI Prompts for Writing**:

    - [ ] Create writing-specific prompt templates
    - [ ] Develop specialized writing modes (e.g., fantasy, mystery, sci-fi)
    - [ ] Implement revision and feedback tools

5. **Documentation**:
    - [ ] User guide for writers
    - [ ] Examples of writing workflows
    - [ ] Best practices for using AI in creative writing

## Progress Status

**Current Phase**: Initial Planning and Setup

**Completed**:

- [x] Initial project setup
- [x] Memory bank documentation
- [x] RooCode codebase exploration

**In Progress**:

- [ ] Planning UI adaptations
- [ ] Designing Task Cards feature

**Next Up**:

- [ ] Implement basic UI terminology changes
- [ ] Create prototype of Task Cards UI

**Overall Progress**: 5% complete

The project is in its early stages, with the foundation being laid for the adaptation from RooCode to MeshWrite. We have a clear understanding of the RooCode architecture and have identified the key areas that need to be modified to create a writer-friendly tool.
