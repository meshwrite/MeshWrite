# MeshWrite: Active Context

## What We're Working On Now

We are currently in the initial phase of adapting RooCode (an AI agent coding assistant) into MeshWrite (an AI assistant for fiction writers). The project is just starting, and we're focusing on:

1. Understanding the RooCode codebase structure and functionality
2. Planning the necessary UI changes to make it writer-friendly
3. Designing the Task Cards feature for writers

## Current Task

Implementing Task Card feature for better task tracking and context management.

### Goals

1. Task Mode Initialization

    - Add "Enable Task Cards" setting to Roo settings
    - Create task_card.json in the same directory as conversation history
    - Initialize task card with metadata and initial context

2. Task Card Integration

    - Append task card content to system prompt
    - Allow model to read and update task card during task execution
    - Maintain task card throughout task lifecycle

3. Task Card Visualization
    - Add a "Task Card" button in the task header (left of the close button)
    - Create a modal/panel UI for visualizing task cards
    - Display task card content in a visually appealing format
    - Show task progress with status indicators (TO DO, IN PROGRESS, DONE)
    - Include task title, steps, context and other relevant information
    - Make it match the visual style of the BeanVoyage example shown in the screenshot

### Recent Changes

- Created task card template and example
- Defined structure for task cards
- Simplified context field to string array format
- Added task card initialization in Cline.ts
- Implemented task card file creation alongside conversation history
- Standardized task card format with metadata, task_title, description, steps, context, notes, and changes fields
- Fixed approval message UI for task card update and retrieval operations
- Added proper task card tool types to ClineSayTool interface

## Next Steps

Our immediate next steps are:

1. **Task Card UI Implementation**:

    - Add a Task Card button to the task header
    - Create a visualization component for the task card
    - Design a UI similar to the BeanVoyage example
    - Implement status indicators for tasks (TO DO, IN PROGRESS, DONE)
    - Add interaction capabilities (view, edit, update task status)

2. **Task Card System Prompt Integration**:

    - Investigate how the system prompt is currently constructed
    - Design a way to include task card content in the system prompt
    - Ensure task card updates are reflected in the system prompt
    - Handle task card state persistence between prompt updates

3. **UI Changes**:

    - Update terminology throughout the UI to be writer-focused
    - Modify the visual design to appeal to creative writers
    - Change icons and labels to reflect writing tasks rather than coding tasks

4. **Testing**:
    - Test the adapted UI with sample writing tasks
    - Ensure all existing functionality works with our modifications
    - Gather feedback on the writer experience

We will focus on creating the task card visualization UI to allow users to easily view and manage their task cards.

### Questions to Investigate

1. How is the task header currently implemented and where is it defined?
2. What's the best approach to add a button to the task header?
3. How should we display the task card visualization (modal, panel, sidebar)?
4. What existing UI components can we leverage for the visualization?
5. How should we handle task status changes and updates?
