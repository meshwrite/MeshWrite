# MeshWrite: Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

MeshWrite is a VSCode extension for fiction writers, adapted from RooCode (an AI agent coding assistant). While RooCode focuses on software development, MeshWrite repurposes this powerful AI agent framework specifically for creative writing and storytelling.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Creative Workflow Management**: Fiction writers often struggle with organizing their creative process, managing multiple storylines, characters, and plot elements.

2. **Writer's Block**: Writers frequently face creative blocks and need assistance to generate ideas, develop characters, or overcome narrative challenges.

3. **Narrative Consistency**: Maintaining consistency across a complex narrative with multiple characters, settings, and plot threads is challenging.

4. **Research Integration**: Writers need to seamlessly integrate research into their creative process without breaking their flow.

5. **Revision and Feedback**: The editing process can be overwhelming without structured tools to manage revisions and implement feedback.

## How It Should Work

MeshWrite will leverage RooCode's AI agent framework but adapt it for fiction writing:

1. **Task Cards**: Writers can create and manage task cards for different aspects of their writing project (character development, scene writing, plot outlining, etc.).

2. **AI-Assisted Writing**: The AI agent can help generate ideas, suggest plot developments, create character backstories, and assist with dialogue.

3. **Story Structure Tools**: Provide templates and guidance for different narrative structures and storytelling techniques.

4. **World-Building Assistance**: Help writers develop consistent and rich fictional worlds, including cultures, geography, and rules.

5. **Revision Assistance**: Analyze drafts for pacing, consistency, character development, and provide targeted feedback.

6. **Research Integration**: Allow writers to seamlessly incorporate research materials into their creative process.

7. **Custom Writing Modes**: Similar to RooCode's custom modes, MeshWrite will offer specialized writing modes for different genres, styles, or writing approaches.

The UI will be adapted to be more writer-friendly, with terminology and features that resonate with creative writers rather than software developers.
